# Let's merge some .css files

Tired of all these css files? 

**css_monticule.php** is a little php script that aggregate all your .css 
files in one, with full automatic versioning and LESS CSS parsing.

## Setup

1. Drag **css_monticule.php** and **lessc.inc.php** on your web server

2. Include and call **css_monticule.php** within your page *via*: 

		<?php
		include_once("css_monticule.php");
		css_monticule("file1.css","file2.css","file3.less");
		?>
it will automatically generate this stylesheet snippet: 

		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css_monticule_cache/1d6ef0c6c917ae65308954239f2a5653_4003591211_5070_monticule.css" />
		
3. That's all. **css_monticule.php** take care of the rest.
